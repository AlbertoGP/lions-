swtch (2178)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2184:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``p'' is a static variable (2180),
 which means that its value is
 initialised to zero (1566) and is
 preserved between calls. For the
 very first call on ``swtch'', ``p''
 is set to point to ``proc[0]'';

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2189:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``savu'' is called to save the
stack pointer and the environment
pointer for the current process
in ``u.u_rsav'';

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2193:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``retu'' is called
to reset the kernel address
register for segment #6 to the
value passed as an argument
(this causes a change in the
current process!), and
 to reset the stack and environment pointers to values
 appropriate to the revised
 current process, whose execution
 is about to be resumed.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The combination of successive calls on
``savu'' and ``retu'' at this point constitutes a so-called ``coroutine jump''
(Cf.
``exchange jump'' on the Cyber or ``Load
PSW'' on the /360 or ``Move Stack'' on the
B6700).

<P>
This time however the coroutine jump is
from process 0 to process 0 (not very
interesting!).

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2201:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The set of processes is searched
 to find the process whose state
 is ``SRUN'' and which is loaded and
 for which ``p_pri'' is a maximum.

<P>
The search is successful and process #1 is found. (N.B. The
state of process #0 was just
changed from ``SRUN'' to ``SSLEEP''
in ``sleep'' so it no longer satisfies the search criterion);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2218:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Since ``p'' is not ``NULL'', the idle
 loop is not entered;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2228:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``retu'' (0740) causes a coroutine
 jump to process #1 which becomes
the current process.

<P>
What is process #1 ? It is a copy
of process #0, made at a previous
stage of the latter's existence.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
This call on ``retu'' was not preceded by
a call on ``savu'' because the necessary
information has in fact been saved
already. (Where?)

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2229:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``sureg'' is a routine 1738) which
 copies into the user mode segmentation registers, the values
 appropriate for the current process.
	These have been stored earlier in the arrays ``u.u_uisa'' and
 ``u.u _uisd''.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The very first call on ``sureg'' copies
zeroes and serves no real purpose.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2240:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The ``SSWAP'' flag is not set, so
 that this enigmatic (2239) section can be
ignored for now;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2247:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Finally ``swtch'' returns with a
 value of ``1''. But where does the ``return'' return to?
<B>Not to ``sleep'' !</B>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The ``return'' follows values set by the
stack pointer and the environment
pointer. These (just before the return)
have values equal to those in force
when the most recent ``savu(u.u_rsav)''
was performed.

<P>
Now process #1, which is only just
starting has never performed a ``savu'',
but values were stored in ``u.u_rsav''
before the copy of process #0 was made
by ``newproc'', which had been called
from ``main''.

<P>
Thus in this case, <I>the return from
``swtch'' is made to ``main'', with a value
of one.</I> (Look over this again, to be
sure you understand!)
