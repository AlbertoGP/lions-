Processes</A>
</H1>

<P>
The previous chapter traced the
developments which occur after ``the
operating system has been rebooted'',
and in so doing introduced a number of
significant features of the process
concept. One of the aims of this
chapter is to go back and re-explore
some of the same ground more
thoroughly.

<P>
There are a number of serious difficulties 
in providing a generally acceptable definition of ``process''. These are
akin to the difficulties faced by the
philosopher who would answer ``what is
life?'' We will be in good company if we
brush the more subtle points lightly
aside.

<P>
The definition for ``process'' already
given, ``a program in execution'', does
reasonably well in suggesting what is
intended. However it does not fit the
case of either process #0 throughout
its life or process #1 during its first
moments. All other processes in the
system however are clearly associated
with the execution of some program file
or other.

<P>
Processes can be introduced into discussions of operating systems at two
levels.

<P>
At the upper level, ``process'' is an
important organising concept for
describing the activity of a computer
system as a whole. It is often
expedient to view the latter as the
combined activity of a number of
processes, each associated with a particular program such as
the ``shell'', or
the ``editor''. A discussion of UNIX at
this level is given in the second half
of Ritchie's and Thompson's paper, ``The
UNIX Time-sharing System''.

<P>
At this level the processes themselves
are considered to be the active entities in the system, while the 
identities of the true active elements, the
processor and the peripheral devices,
are submerged: the processes are born,
live and die; they exist in varying
numbers; they may acquire and release
resources; they may interact,
cooperate, conflict, share resources;
etc.

<P>
At the lower level, ``processes'' are
inactive entities which are acted on by
active entities such as the processor.
By allowing the processor to switch
frequently from the execution of one
process image to another, the impression can
be created that each of the process images is
developing continuously and this leads to the upper level
interpretation.

<P>
Our present concern is with the low
level interpretation: with the structure of the process image, with the
details of execution and with the means
for switching the processor between
processes.

<P>
The following observations may be made
about processes in the UNIX context:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>(a)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the existence of a process is
implied by the existence of a
non-null structure in the ``proc''
array, i.e. a ``proc'' structure
for which the element ``p_stat''
is non-null;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>(b)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>for each process there is a ``per
process data area'' containing a
copy of the ``user'' structure;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>(c)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the processor spends its entire
life executing one process or
another (except when it is resting between instructions);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>(d)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>it is possible for one process
to create or destroy another
process;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>(e)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a process may acquire and possess resources of various kinds.
</DD>
</DL>
