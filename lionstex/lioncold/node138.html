clock (3725)</A>
</H2>

<P>
The function of ``clock'' is one of general housekeeping:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the display register is updated
(PDP11/45 and 11/70 only);

<P>
</LI>
<LI>various accounting values such as
the time of day, accumulated processing times
and execution profiles are maintained;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>processes sleeping for a fixed
time interval are awakened as per
schedule;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>core swapping activity is initiated once per second.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
``clock'' breaks most of the rules for
peripheral device handlers: it does
reference the current ``u'' structure,
and it also runs at a low priority for
some of the time. It abbreviates its
activity if a previous execution has
not yet completed.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>3740:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``display'' is a no-op on the
 PDP11/40;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3743:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The array ``callout'' (0265) is an
 array of ``NCALL'' (0143) structures
of type ``callo'' (0260).
The ``callo'' structure contains
three elements: an incremental
time, an argument and the address
of a function. When the function
element is not null, the function
is to be executed with the supplied
argument after a specified time.

<P>
(For the systems under study, the
only function ever executed in
this way is ``ttrstrt'' (8486),
handler. (See Chapter 25.));

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3748:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the first element of the list
 is null, the whole list is null;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3750:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The ``callout'' list is arranged in
 the desired order of execution.
 The time recorded is the number
of clock ticks between events.
Unless the first time (the time
before the next event) is already
zero, (meaning that the execution
is already due) this time should
be decremented by one.

<P>
If this time has already been
counted to zero, decrement the
next time unless it is already
zero also, etc. i.e. decrement
the first non-zero time in the
list. All the leading entries
with zero times represent operations which are already due. (The
operations are actually carried
out a little later.);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3759:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Examine the previous processor
status word, and if the priority
was non-zero, bypass the next
section, which executes those
operations which are due;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3766:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Reduce the processor priority to
five (other level six interrupts
may now occur);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3767:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Search the ``callout'' array looking
for operations which are due and execute them;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3773:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Move the entries for operations
which are still not yet due, to
 the beginning of the array;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3787:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The code from here until line
3797 is executed, whatever the
previous processor priority, at
either priority level five or
six;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3788:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the previous mode was ``user
 mode'', then increment the user
 time counter, and if an execution
 profile is being accumulated,
 call ``incupc'' (a895) to make an
 entry in a histogram for the user
 mode program counter (PC).

<P>
``incupc'' is written in assembler,
presumably for efficiency and
convenience. A description of
what it does may be found in the
section ``PROFIL(II)'' of the UPM.
See also the procedure ``profil''
(3667);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3792:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the previous mode was not user
mode, increment the system (kernel) time counter for the process.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The code just described performs the
basic time accounting for the system.
Every clock tick results in the incrementing of either ``u.u_utime'' or
``u.u_stime'' for some process. Both
``u.u_utime'' and ``u.u_stime'' are
initialised to zero in ``fork'' (3322). Their
values are interrogated in ``wait''
(3270). The values will go negative
after 32K ticks (about 10 hours)!

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>3795:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``p_cpu'' is used in determining
 process priorities. It is a character value which is always
 interpreted as a positive integer
 (0 to 255). When it is moved to a
 special register, sign extension
 occurs so that 255, for instance,
 becomes like -1. Adding one then
 leaves a zero result. In this
 case the value is reduced to -1
 again, and stored as 255
 unsigned. Note that in the other
 places where ``p_cpu'' is referenced (2161, 3814), the top eight
 bits are masked off after the
 value has been transferred to a
 special register;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3797:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Increment ``lbolt'' and if it
exceeds ``HZ'', i.e. a second or
more has elapsed ...

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3798:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Then provided the processor was
 not previously running at a nonzero priority, do a whole lot of
 housekeeping;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3800:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Decrement ``lbolt'' by ``HZ'';

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3801:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Increment the time of day accumulator;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3803:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The events which follow may take
 some time, but they may reasonably be interrupted to service
 other peripherals. So the processor priority is dropped below all
 the device priority levels i.e.
 below <B>four</B>.

<P>
However there is now a possibility of another clock interrupt
before this activation of the
``clock'' procedure is completed.
By setting the processor priority
to <B>one</B> rather than to <B>zero</B>, a
second activation of ``clock'' will
not attempt to execute the code
from line 3804 on also. Note however that
to the hardware, priority one is functionally the same
as priority zero;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3804:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the current time (measured in
 seconds) is equal to the value
 stored in ``tout'', wake all
 processes which have elected to
 suspend themselves for a period
 of time via the ``sleep'' system
 call i.e. via the procedure
 ``sslep'' (5979).
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
``tout'' stores the time at which the
next process is to be awakened. If
there is more than one such process,
then the remainder, which will have
been disturbed, must reset ``tout''
between them. This mechanism, while
quite effective, will not be efficient
if the number of such processes ever
becomes large.

<P>
In this situation, a mechanism similar
to the ``callout'' array (see 3767) would
need to be provided. (In fact, how difficult would it be to merge the two
mechanisms? What would be the disadvantages ??);

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>3806:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When the last two bits of
 ``time[1]'' are zero i.e. every
 four seconds, reset the scheduling flag ``runrun'' and wake up
 everything waiting for a ``lightning bolt''. (``lbolt'' represents a
 general event which is caused
 every four seconds, to initiate
 miscellaneous housekeeping. It is
 used by ``pcopen'' (8648).);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3810:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>For all currently defined
 processes:

<P>
increment ``p_time'' up to a maximum
of 127 (it is only a character
variable);

<P>
decrement ``p_cpu'' by ``SCHMAG''
(3707) but do not allow it to go
negative. Note that as discussed
earlier (line 3795) ``p_cpu'' is
treated as a positive integer in
the range 0 to 255;

<P>
if the processor priority is currently set
at a depressed value, recalculate it.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Note that ``p_cpu'' enters into the calculation of process priorities,
``p_pri'', by ``setpri'' (2156). ``p_pri''
is used by ``swtch'' (2209) in choosing
which process, from among those which
are in core (``SLOAD'') and ready to run
(``SRUN''), should next receive the CPU's
attention.

<P>
``p_time'' is used to measure how long
(in seconds) a process has been either
in core or swapped out to disk.
``p_time'' is set to zero by ``newproc''
(1869), by ``sched'' (2047) and by
``xswap'' (4386). It is used by ``sched''
(1962, 2009) to determine which
processes to swap in or out.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>3820:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the scheduler is waiting to
 rearrange things, wake it up.
 Thus the normal rate for scheduling decisions is once per second;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>3824:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the previous mode before the
 interrupt was ``user mode'', store
 the address of ``r0'' in a standard
 place, and if a ``signal'' has been
 received for the process, call
 ``psig'' (4043) for the appropriate
 action.
</DD>
</DL>
