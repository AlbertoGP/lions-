The Directory Data Structure</A>
</H2>

<P>
Each file must have at least one  name.
A file may have more than one  distinct
name, but the  same  name  may  not  be
shared  by  tw  distinct  files,  i.e.
each name must define a unique file.

<P>
A name may be multipart.  When written,
the parts or components of the name are
separated by slashes (``/'').  The  order
of components within a name is significant i.e. 
``a/b/c''  is  different  from ``a/c/b''.

<P>
If file  names  are  divided  into  two
parts:  an initial part or ``stem'' and a
final part or ``ending'', then two  files
whose  names  have  identical stems are
usually relate in some way.  They  may
reside  on  the  same  disk,  they  may
belong to the same user, etc.
Users make initial reference  to  files
by  quoting  the file name, e.g. in the
``open''  system  call.    An   important
operating  sysem function is to decode
the name into the corresponding ``inode''
entry.   To  do  this, UNIX creates and
maintains a directory  data  structure.
This   structure  is  equivalent  to  a
directed graph with named edges.

<P>
In its purest form, the graph is a tree
i.e.  it  has  a single root node, with
exactly one path between the  root  and
any  node.  More  commonly in UNIX (but
not so commonly in other operating systems) the graph is a lattice  which may
be obtained from a tree  by  coalescing
one or more groups of leaves.

<P>
In this case, while there is still only
one path between the root and any interior node, thee may be more  than  one
path  between  the  root  and  a  leaf.
Leaves are nodes without successors and
correspond to  data  files.  Interior
nodes are  nodes  with  successors  and
correspond to directory files.

<P>
The name for a file  is  obtained  from
the  names  of  the  edges  of the path
between   the   root   and   the   node
corresponding  to  the file.  (For this
reason, the name is often  referred  to
as  a ``pathname''.) If there are several
paths, then the file has several names.

<P>
