<DT><STRONG>0613:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The ``enabled'' bit of the memory
 management status register, SR0,
 is tested. If this set, the processor will dwell forever in a
 two instruction loop. This register will normally be cleared when
 the operator activates the
 ``clear'' button on the console
 before starting the system.

<P>
A number of reasons have been
suggested for the necessity for
this loop. The most likely is
that in the case of a double bus
timeout error, the processor will
branch to location zero, and in
this situation it should not be
allowed to go further.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0615:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``reset'' clears and initialises
 all the peripheral device control
 and status registers

<P>
<I>The system will now be running in
kernel mode with memory management
disabled.</I>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0619:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>KISA0 and KISD0 are the high core
 addresses of the first pair of
 kernel mode segmentation registers. The first six kernel
 descriptor registers are initialised to 077406, which is the
 description of a full size, 4K
 word, read/write segment.

<P>
The first six kernel address
registers are initialised to 0,
0200, 0400, 0600, 01000 and 01200
respectively.

<P>
As a result the first six kernel
segments are initialised (without
any reference to the actual size
of UNIX) to point to the first
six 4K word segments of physical
memory. Thus the ``kernel to physical address'' translation is
trivial for kernel addresses in
the range 0 to 0137777;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0632:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``_end'' is a loader pseudo variable which defines the extent of
 the program code and data area.
 This value is rounded up to the
 next multiple of 64 bytes and is
 stored in the address register
 for the seventh segment (segment
 #6).

<P>
Note that the address of this
register is stored in ``ka6'', so
that the content of this register
is accessible as ``*ka6'';

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0634:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The corresponding descriptor
 register is loaded with a value
 which (since ``USIZE'' is equal to
 16) is the description of a
 read/write segment which is 16 x
 32 = 512 words long.

<P>
The value 007406 is obtained by
shifting the octal value 017
eight places to the left and then
``or''ing in the value 6;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0641:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The eighth segment is mapped into
 the highest 4K word segment of
 the physical address space.

<P>
It should be noted that with
memory management disabled, the
same translation is already in
force i.e. addresses in the
highest 4K word segment of the
32K program address space are
automatically mapped into the
highest 4K word segment of the
physical address space.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
We may note that from this point on,
all the kernel mode segmentation registers will remain unchanged with the
single exception of the <B>seventh kernel
segmentation address register</B>.

<P>
This register is explicitly manipulated
by UNIX to point to a variety of
locations in physical memory. Each such
location is the beginning of an area
512 words long, known as a ``per process
data area''.

<P>
The seventh kernel address register is
now set to point to the segment which
will become the per process data area
for process #0.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>0646:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The stack pointer is set to point
 to the highest word of the per
 process data area;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0647:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>By incrementing the value of SR0
 from zero to one, the ``memory
 management enabled'' bit is conveniently set.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
<I>From this point, all program addresses
are translated to physical addresses
the memory management hardware.</I>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>0649:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``bss'' refers to the second part
 of the program data area, which
 is not initialised by the loader
 (see ``A.OUT(V)'' in the PM). The
 lower and upper limits of this
 area are defined by the loader
 pseudo variables, ``_edata'' and
 ``_end'' respectively;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0668:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The processor status word (PS) is
 changed to indicate that the
 ``previous mode'' was ``user mode''.

<P>
This prepares the way for the
investigation and initialisation
of the areas of physical memory
which are not part of the kernel
address space. (This involves use
of the special instructions
``mtpi'' and ``mfpi'' (Move To/From
Previous Instruction space)
together with some manipulation
of the user mode segmentation
registers.);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>0669:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A call is then made to the procedure ``main'' (1550).
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
It will be seen later that ``main'' calls
``sched'' which never terminates. The
need for or use of the last three
instructions of ``start'' (lines 0670,
0671 and 0672) is therefore somewhat
enigmatic. The reason will come later.
In the meantime you might like to
ponder ``why?''. What do these lines do
anyway?
