Race Conditions</A>
</H2>

<P>
The code for ``swap'' has a number of
interesting features. In particular it
displays in microcosm the problems of
race conditions when several processes
are running together.

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
Consider the following scenario:

<P>
No swapping is taking place when process A initiates a swapping operation.
Denoting ``swbuf.b_flags'' by simply
``flags'', we have initially

<P>
<PRE>
  flags == null
</PRE>

<P>
Process A is not delayed at line 5204,
initiates its i/o operation and goes to
sleep at line 5215. We now have

<P>
<PRE>
  flags == B_BUSY | B_PHYS | rdflg
</PRE>

<P>
which was set at line 5206.

<P>
Suppose now while the i/o operation is
proceeding, process B also initiates a
swapping operation. It too begins to
execute ``swap'', but finds the ``B_BUSY''
flag set, so it sets the ``B_WANTED''
flag (5203) and goes to sleep also
(5204). We now have

<P>
<PRE>
  flags == B_BUSY | B_PHYS | rdflg | B_WANTED
</PRE>

<P>
At last the i/o operation completes.
Process C takes the interrupt and executes ``rkintr'', which calls (5471)
``iodone'' which calls (5301) ``wakeup'' to
awaken process A and process B.
``iodone'' also sets the ``B_DONE'' flag
and resets the ``B_WANTED'' flag so that

<P>
<PRE>
  flags == B_BUSY | B_PHYS | rdflg | B_DONE
</PRE>

<P>
What happens next depends on the order
in which process A and process B are
reactivated. (Since they both have the
same priority, ``PSWP'', it is a toss-up
which goes first.)

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Case (a):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Process A goes first.
``B_DONE'' is set so no more sleeping is
needed. ``B_WANTED'' is reset so there is
no one to ``wakeup''. Process A tidies up
(5219), and leaves ``swap'' with

<P>
<PRE>
  flags == B_PHYS | rdflg | B_DONE
</PRE>

<P>
Process B now runs and is able to initiate its i/o operation without further
delay.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Case (b):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Process B goes first. It
 finds ``B_BUSY'' on, so it turns the
 ``B_WANTED'' flag back on, and goes to
 sleep again, leaving

<P>
<PRE>
  flags == B_BUSY | B_PHYS | rdflg |
           B_DONE | B_WANTED
</PRE>

<P>
Process A starts again as in Case (a),
but this time finds ``B_WANTED'' on so it
must call ``wakeup'' (5217) in addition
to its other chores. Process B finally
wakes again and the whole chain completes.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Case (b) is obviously much less efficient than case (a). It would seem that
a simple change to line 5215 to read

<P>
<PRE>
  sleep (fp, PSWP-1);
</PRE>

<P>
would cost virtually nothing and ensure
that Case (b) never occurred!

<P>
The necessity for the raising of processor priority at various points
should be studied: for example if line
5201 was omitted and if process B had
just completed line 5203 when the ``i/o
complete'' interrupt occurred for Process A's operation, then ``iodone'' would
turn off ``B_WANTED'' and perform
``wakeup'' before process B went to sleep ... forever! A bad scene.

<P>
