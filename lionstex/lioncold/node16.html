A Note on Programming Standards</A>

<P>
You will find that most of the code in
UNIX is of a very high standard. Many
sections which initially seem complex
and obscure, appear in the light of
further investigation and reflection,
to be perfectly obvious and ``the only
way to fly''.

<P>
For this reason, the occasional comments
in the notes on programming
style, almost invariably refer to
apparent lapses from the usual standard
of near perfection.

<P>
What caused these? Sometimes it appears
that the original code has been patched
expediently. More than once apparent
lapses have proved not to be such: the
``bad'' code has been found in fact to
incorporate some subtle feature which
was not at all apparent initially. And
some allowance is certainly needed for
occasional human weakness.

<P>
But on the whole you will find that the
authors of UNIX, Ken Thompson and
Dennis Ritchie, have created a program
of great strength, integrity and effectiveness,
which you should admire and seek to emulate.
