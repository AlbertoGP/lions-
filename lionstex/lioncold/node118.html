Critical Sections</A>
</H2>

<P>
If two or more processes operate on the
same set of data, then the combined
output of the set of processes may
depend on the relative synchronisation
of the various processes.

<P>
This is usually considered to be highly
undesirable and to be avoided at all
costs. The solution is usually to
define ``critical sections'' (it is the
programmer's responsibility to recognise these) in the code which is executed by each process. The programmer
must then ensure that at any time no
more than process is executing a
section of code which is critical with
respect to a part1cular set of data.

<P>
In UNIX user processes do not share
data and so do not conflict in this
way. Kernel processes however have
shared access to various system data
and can conflict.

<P>
In UNIX an interrupt does not cause a
change in process as a direct side
effect. Only where kernel processes
may suspend themselves in the middle of
a critical section by an explicit call
on ``sleep'', does an explicit lock variable which may be observed by a group
of processes) need to be introduced.
Even then the actions of testing and
setting the locks do not usually have
to be made inseparable.

<P>
Some critical sections of code are executed by interrupt
handlers. To protect other sections of code whose outcome may
be affected by the handling of
certain interrupts, the processor
priority is raised temporarily high
enough before the critical section is
entered to delay such interrupts until
it is safe, when the processor priority
is reduced again. There are of course
a number of conventions which interrupt
handling code should observe, as will
be discussed later in Chapter Nine.

<P>
In passing it may be noted that the
strategy adopted by UNIX works only for
a single processor system and would be
totally inappropriate in a multiprocessor system.
