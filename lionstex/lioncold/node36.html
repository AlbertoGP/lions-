Example 3</A>
</H2>

<P>
<PRE>
  6585 bcopy (from, to, count)
       int *from, *to;
       {
        register *a, *b, c;
        a = from;
        b = to;
        c = count;
        do
          *b++ = *a++;
        while (--cc);
       }
</PRE>

<P>
The function of this procedure is very
simple: it copies a specified number of
words from one set of consecutive
locations to another set.

<P>
There are three parameters. The second
line

<P>
<PRE>
   int *from, *to;
</PRE>

<P>
specifies that the first two variables
are pointers to integers. Since no
specification is supplied for the third
parameter, it is assumed to be an
integer by default.

<P>
The three local variables, a, b, and c,
have been assigned to registers,
because registers are more accessible
and the object code to reference them
is shorter. ``a'' and ``b'' are pointers to
integers and ``c'' is an integer. The
register declaration could have been
written more pedantically as

<P>
<PRE>
   register int *a, *b, c;
</PRE>

<P>
to emphasise the connection with
integers.

<P>
The three lines beginning with ``do''
should be studied carefully. If ``b'' is
a ``pointer to integer'' type, then

<P>
<PRE>
    *b
</PRE>

<P>
denotes the integer pointed to. Thus to
copy the value pointed to by ``a'' to the
location designated by ``b'', we could
write

<P>
<PRE>
    *b = *a;
</PRE>

<P>
If we wrote instead

<P>
<PRE>
    b = a;
</PRE>

<P>
this would make the value of ``b'' the
same as the value of ``a'', i.e. ``b'' and
``a'' would point to the same place.
Here at least, that is not what is
required.

<P>
Having copied the first word from
source to destination, we need to
increase the values of ``b'' and ``a'' so
that the point to the next words of
their respective sets. This can be done
by writing

<P>
<PRE>
    b = b+1; a = a+1;
</PRE>

<P>
but ``C'' provides a shorter notation
(which is more useful when the variable
names are longer) viz.

<P>
<PRE>
    b++; a++;
</PRE>

<P>
Now there is no difference between the
statements ``b++;'' and ``++b;'' here.

<P>
However ``b++'' and ``++b'' may be used as
terms in an expression, in which case
they are different. In both cases the
effect of incrementing ``b'' is retained,
but the value which enters the expression is
the initial value for ``b++'' and
the final value for ``++b''.

<P>
The ``<IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$--$">'' operator obeys the same rules
as the ``++'' operator, except that it
decrements by one. Thus ``<IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$--$">c'' enters an
expression as the value after decrementation.

<P>
The ``++'' and ``<IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$--$">'' operators are very
useful, and are used throughout UNIX.
Occasionally you will have to go back
to first principles to work out exactly
what their use implies. Note also
there is a difference between <TT>*b++</TT> and <TT>(*b)++</TT>.

<P>
These operators are applicable to
pointers to structures as well as to
simple data types. When a pointer
which has been declared with reference
to a particular type of structure is
incremented, the actual value of the
pointer is incremented by the size of
the structure.

<P>
We can now see the meaning of the line

<P>
<PRE>
    *b++ = *a++;
</PRE>

<P>
The word is copied and the pointers are
incremented, all in one hit.

<P>
The line

<P>
<PRE>
    while (--c);
</PRE>

<P>
delimits the end of the set of statements
which began after the ``do''. The
expression in parentheses ``<IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$--$">c'', is
evaluated and tested (the value tested
is the value after decrementation). If
the value is non-zero, the loop is
repeated, else it is terminated.

<P>
Obviously if the initial value for
``count'' were negative, the loop would
not terminate properly. If this were a
serious possibility then the routine
would have to be modified.
