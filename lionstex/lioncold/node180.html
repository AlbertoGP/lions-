sched (1940)</A>
</H2>

<P>
Process #0 executes ``sched''. When it is
not waiting for the completion of an
input/output operation that it has initiated, it spends most of its time
waiting in one of the following situations:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>A. (runout)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>None of the processes which are
 swapped out is ready to run, so
 that there is nothing to do. The
 situation may be changed by a call
 to ``wakeup'', or to ``xswap'' called
 by either ``newproc'' or ``expand''.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>B. (runin)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>There is at least one process
 swapped out and ready to run, but
 it hasn't been out more than 3
 seconds and/or none of the
 processes presently in main memory
 is inactive or has been there more
 than 2 seconds. The situation may
be changed by the effluxion of
time as measured by ``clock'' or by
a call to ``sleep''.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
When either of these situations terminate:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>1958:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>With the processor running at
 priority six, so that the clock
 can't interrupt and change values
 of ``p_time'', a search is made for
 the process which is ready to run
 and has been swapped out for the
 longest time;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>1966:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If there is no such process then
situation A holds;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>1976:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Search for a main memory area of
 adequate size to hold the data
 segment. If an associated text
 segment must be present also but
 is not currently in main memory,
 the area is increased by the size
 of the text segment;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>1982:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If an area of adequate size is
 available the program branches to
 ``found2'' (2031). (Note that the
 program does not handle the case
 where there is sufficient space
 for both text and data segments
 but in distinct areas of main
 memory. Would it be worth while
 to extend the code to cover this
 possibility?);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>1990:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Search for a process which is in
 main memory, but which is not the
 scheduler or locked (i.e. already
 being swapped out), and whose
 state is ``SWAIT'' or ``SSTOP'' (but
 <B>not</B>
<BR>``SSLEEP'') (i.e. the process
 is waiting for an event of low
 precedence, or has stopped during
 tracing (see Chapter Thirteen)).
 If such a process is found, go to
 line 2021, to swap the image out.

<P>
Note that there seems to be a
bias here against processes whose
``proc'' entries are early in the
``proc'' array;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2003:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the image to be swapped in has
 been out less than 3 seconds,
 then situation B holds;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2005:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Search for the process which is
 loaded, but is not the scheduler
 or locked, whose state is ``SRUN''
 or ``SSLEEP'' (i.e. ready to run,
 or waiting for an event of high
 precedence) and which has been in
 main memory for the longest time;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2013:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the process image to be
 swapped out has been in main
 memory for less than 2 seconds,
 then situation B holds.

<P>
The constant ``2'' here (also the
``3'' on line 2003) is somewhat
arbitrary. For some reason the
programmer has departed from his
usual practice of naming such
constants to emphasise their origins;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2022:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The process image is flagged as
 not loaded and is swapped out
 using ``xswap'' (4368).

<P>
Note that the ``SSWAP'' flag is not
set here because the process
swapped out is not the current
process. (Cf. lines 1907, 2286);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2032:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Read the text segment into main
 memory if necessary. Note that
 the arguments for the ``swap'' procedure are:
	
<UL>
<LI>an address within the swap area of the disk;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>a main memory address (ordinal
number of a 32 word block);

<P>
</LI>
<LI>a size (number of 32 word blocks
to be transferred);

<P>
</LI>
<LI>a direction indicator
(``B_READ==1'' denotes ``disk to
main memory'');
	
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2042:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Swap in the data segment and ...

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2044:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Release the disk swap area to the
 available list, record the main
 memory address, set the ``SLOAD''
 flag and reset the accumulated
 time indicator.
</DD>
</DL>
