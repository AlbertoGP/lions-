<H2><A NAME="SECTION00099000000000000000">
putchar (2386)</A>
</H2>

<P>
This procedure transmits to the system
console the character which was passed
as a parameter.

<P>
It illustrates in a small way the basic
features of i/o operations on the PDP11
computer.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2391:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>``SW'' is defined on line 0166 as
 the value ``0177570''. This is the
kernel address of a read only
processor register which stores
the setting of the console switch
register.

<P>
The meaning of the statement is
clear: get the contents at location 0177570 and see if they are
zero. The problem is to express
this in ``C''. The code

<P>
if (SW == 0)

<P>
would not have conveyed this
meaning. Clearly ``SW'' is a
pointer value which should be
dereferenced. The compiler might
have been changed to accept

<P>
if (SW-<IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$&gt;$"> == 0)

<P>
but as it stands, this is syntactically incorrect. By inventing a
dummy structure, with an element
``integ'' (see line 0175), the programmer has found a satisfactory
solution to his problem.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Several other examples of this programming device will be found in this
procedure and elsewhere.

<P>
In hardware terms, the system console
terminal interface consists of four 16
bit control registers which are given
consecutive addresses on the Unibus
beginning at kernel address 0177560
(see the declaration for ``KL'' on line
0165.) For a description of the formats
and usage of these registers, see
Chapter Twenty-Four of the ``PDP11 Peripherals Handbook''.

<P>
In software terms, this interface is
the unnamed structure which is defined
beginning on line 2313, with four elements which name the four control
registers. It does not matter that the
structure is unnamed because it is not
necessary to allocate any instances of
it (the one we are interested in is
essentially predefined, at the address
given by ``KL'').

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2393:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>While bit 7 of the transmitter
 status register (``XST'') is off,
 keep doing nothing, because the
 interface is not ready to accept
 another character.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
This is a classic case of ``busy waiting'' where the processor is allowed to
cycle uselessly through a set of
instructions until some externally
defined event occurs. Such waste of
processing power cannot normally be
tolerated but this procedure is only
used in unusual situations.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2395:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The need for this statement is
 tied up with the statement on
 line 2405;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2397:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Save the current contents of the
 transmitter status register;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2398:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Clear the transmitter status
 register preparatory to sending
 the next character:

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2399:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>With bit 7 of the control status
 register reset, move the next
 character to be transmitted to
 the transmitter buffer register.
 This initiates the next output
 operation;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2400:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A ``new line'' character needs to
 be accompanied by a ``carriage
 return'' character and this is
 accomplished by a recursive call
 on ``putchar''.

<P>
A couple of extra ``delete'' characters are thrown in also to
allow for any delays in completing the carriage return operation
at the terminal;

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2405:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This call on ``putchar'' with an
 argument of zero effectively
 results in a re-execution of
 lines 2391 to 2394.

<P>
(It is very hard to see why the
programmer chose to use a recursive call here in preference to
simply repeating lines 2393 and
2394, since both code efficiency
and compactness not to mention
clarity seem to have suffered.);

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>2406:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Restore the contents of the
 transmitter status register. In
 particular if bit 6 was formerly
 set to enable interrupts then
 this resets it.
</DD>
</DL>
